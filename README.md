vipaccess-go is a partial [Go](https://golang.org) port of [@cyrozap's python-vipaccess](https://github.com/cyrozap/python-vipaccess). The command line tool [`vipaccess`](cmd/vipaccess) invents a request simulating a random iMac and requests a new credential for it, then outputs the otpauth URI containing the OTP secret. Optionally it can write out a PNG file containing a QR code that encodes the URI for easy import into OTP clients like Google Authenticator or 1Password.

The purpose of this tool is to make it possible to generate TOTP codes for sites using VIP Access without using a Symantec app to do so, since secrets for credentials generated by the official apps are not exposed to the user and so cannot be backed up. Though such sites generally have an out of band account reset method (frequently SMS based, unfortunately), taking responsibility for one's own 2FA secrets removes the need to use such a method if access to a device is lost.
